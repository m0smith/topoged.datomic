## Why Topoged Organize?

Listen to any conversation about Family Search and eventually the statement "Someone broke my tree" will come up.  Why?  Because Family Search allows different people to change data and realtionships.  In addition, Family Search doesn't really support on-going research.

This project is a companion that helps in research and keeping the data straight in Family Search.  Even if someone makes changes you don't agree with, your data is always safe.
